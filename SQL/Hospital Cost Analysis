Summary of Analysis 

In this thorough analysis of sample hospital insurance data, I used SQL to analyze insightful patterns within the given table. 
The initial focus on demographics revealed a gender distribution and average BMI for males and females, offering a foundational 
understanding of the patient population. The exploration of total costs and average BMI across different regions highlighted potential
health variations, aiding in targeted resource allocation. The examination of smoking prevalence by region, laid the groundwork for
tailored health promotion initiatives. The distinction between smokers and non-smokers provided insights into the financial aspects 
of healthcare, while age-based charge categorization shed light on the economic implications at different life stages. 
This analysis equips healthcare professionals with valuable information for informed decision-making, enhancing resource efficiency, 
and financial planning.
